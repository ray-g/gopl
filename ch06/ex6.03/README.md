# Exercise 6.3 (P167)

`(*IntSet).UnionWith` computes the union of two sets using `|`, the word-parallel bitwise OR operator.
Implement methods for `IntersectWith`, `DifferenceWith` and `SymmetricDifference` for the corresponding set operations.
(The symmetric difference of two sets contains the elements present in one set or the other but not both.)
